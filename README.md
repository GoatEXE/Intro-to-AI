##  Intro
Hello friend! My name is Dustin and I'm an IT healthcare professional. I've been in the world of professional tech for 7+ years now. A lot of what I do on the daily is greatly empowered by leveraging the use of technology and AI. When I write here, I'm coming from experience and passion, both of which I would love to share and spread as much as possible. More to come!


## Overview
This is a collection of my understanding on what AI is and how you could practically use it in your every day life. It occurs to me that normal people (non-nerds :D) could get lost in the sea of overcomplication that is the internet. I'll do my best to break down the thought process as well as I can. The neat part here is that I'm using AI to cover the key points of interest on the topic of AI. 


## Structure
Similar to crawl/walk/run, I'm organizing this topic into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Within each folder, you'll find topics that match each difficulty. You can expect examples of generative AI(text, images, audio), natural language processing, and even fine-tuning your own AI(work in progress).

Each section will have a readme (what you're reading now) and any associated examples will also be contained within the active difficulty. I intend accessibility and clarity to be key assets overall.
