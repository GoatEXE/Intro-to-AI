## What is AI?
You can think of an Artificial Intelligence as something that closely resembles Alexa, or Siri(assistants). The biggest difference is that your traditional AI is something that is capable of learning from previous conversations to give more accurate responses. A generative AI is trained on a huge number of conversations, even before they're put into production, which is why it's capable of telling or doing mostly anything you can imagine.


## Common Concepts
### Prompt Engineering
You can think of prompt engineering as a very specific way of talking to AI. As a rule of thumb, try to talk to AI in a way that specifically highlights what you want your final outcome to be. For example, `Tell me about this.` is be vague, and the AI will likely flood you with information that you likely weren't looking for. Instead, try `Please summarize the main points in this email pertaining to tomorrow's meeting.` This is specific and contextual and will get you exactly what you're looking for.  


### LLM
Large Language Model is a term used to describe a specific AI that has a specific purpose. For example, DALL-E is a LLM that was trained specifically for image generation. 


### Fine-Tuning
When people create AIs to fit specific use cases, it must go through a process called fine-tuning to get the accuracy needed to complete that task. Usually, they'll select a base model that mostly fits their theme, then fine-tuning starts by passing a dataset to it. See below.


### Dataset
Think of a dataset as a bunch of data with a theme. Filling a broad idea: Imagine owning a ticketing system. If you had a list of every ticket's issues and how they were resolved. You could then take a pre-trained language model, feed it your dataset(your ticket list), then the outcome would be an AI who's capable of answering common questions that your helpdesk often does, or even guiding people through specific processes. More to come.


## Impact on Life
Speaking from experience, I've seen AI make huge improvements on the ease of work. There's no telling how much I've saved myself from doing just by thinking how AI can assist. Not only that, but even in healthcare as well. AI can identify fractures in pictures of x-rays, or even serve as a counselor or advisor. The biggest problem here is the human factor. As long as you have the data and imagination, not even the sky is a limit for how AI can help make your life easier.


## Concerns
### Private Information
Since public AIs have the capability to learn from conversations that users have with it, the best practice in handling these conversations are to keep any personally identifiable information out of the context of the conversation.


### Bias
Language models that have been fine-tuned from specific datasets are more likely to be bias toward that dataset, even if the data it was trained on wasn't true. Given this, AI is not perfect and can certainly make mistakes.


### Censorship
Ethical considerations are built into most public AIs. For example, I can't ask AI what the best practices are for making an explosive device and expect to receive a serious answer.


## Getting started with AI
### OpenAI and ChatGPT-4o
ChatGPT-4o is the most recent language model made by [OpenAI](https://openai.com). OpenAI has a massive following, and I come to find that it has a huge involvment for setting the pace in the world of AI. If you haven't done so already, I want you to [create an account](https://chat.openai.com) with OpenAI. 

OpenAI is completely free to use, outside of the use of API's (more on this in the next section). 4o is multimodal, meaning you're capable of communicating with it in voice, text, or even ask it questions about a picture you took. It's really awesome, and I'd like you to try it on your own time. 

There's an app that unlocks most of those features: 

- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt&hl=en_US&pli=1)
- [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chatgpt/id6448311069)

Keep in mind that you have a certain amount of prompts to 4o before it reverts you back to the ChatGPT 3.5 LLM(unlimited). You can pay a $20/month subscription to OpenAI for 5x the 4o prompts, and a plethora of other features including image generation.


### Use Cases
This is a bit of the iceberg to get you thinking about how you can leverage AI:

 - Information gathering
    - I find this easier than googling complicated questions.
    - Personal learning
    - Advice on business ideas
 - Chatbot
    - Counseling (You might need an encouraging word after a long day)
    - Role playing (e.g. assistant/customer, patient/provider, disaster recovery)
 - Image Generation
    - Logo generator
    - I imagine this being a source of inspiration
 - Topic Generation (podcasts, YouTube videos, etc.)
    - Script generation
 - General Generation
    - Themed Poems/Haikus
    - Themed names
    - Essays
    - Jokes
 - Editor
    - Given that you've written content, you can pass it to AI for it to adjust in specific ways
 - Data formatting/arranging (you can attach files)
 - Coding/Programming Co-pilot
    - Is this best practice?
    - Is there a better way to do this?
 - Language Translator
