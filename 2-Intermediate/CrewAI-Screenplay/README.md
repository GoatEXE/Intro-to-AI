# Console Output

## Description
The following console ouput was created from running the `party.py` script. This is an example of the collaboration of "agents" within CrewAI:

> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...
The first step in creating this screenplay is to delegate tasks to the writers. The Warlock Writer is known for their ability to write complex and intriguing dialogues, so they would be the best choice for writing the dialogue between the party and Malagan. The Paladin Writer is known for their ability to write action scenes, so they would be the best choice for writing the scenes of the party working their way through the assassin's guild's lair. 
The Monk Writer is known for their ability to write emotional and dramatic scenes, so they would be the best choice for writing the scenes involving the party's decision to bind their souls to Malagan. The Rogue Writer is known for their ability to write suspenseful and unpredictable scenes, so they would be the best choice for writing the scenes involving the party's jobs for Malagan and the potential consequences of Malagan's death.

Action: Delegate work to co-worker
Action Input: {"coworker": "Warlock Writer", "task": "Write the dialogue between the party and Malagan", "context": "The party has worked its way through the secret lair of the Candlekeep assassin's guild in an attempt to recover a member of the party, Leonitus. They meet Malagan, the leader of the assassin's guild, who offers to release Leonitus if each member of the party binds their soul to him and completes jobs for him. This lasts until the debt coin value of their debt is paid. If Malagan dies after they are bound, Malagan and all who are bound to him die too via the magic of that bond."}

To fully embody Ancalagon, I must consider his silent nature, his strong sense of family, and his warlock abilities. His reticence means that he will speak only when necessary, but the mention of binding souls might trigger him due to his arcane knowledge and also because it's a threat to his newfound family - his party. Ancalagon is not a fan of being controlled or indebted to anyone, especially someone like Malagan. This situation is likely to provoke a visceral reaction from him, possibly even anger or disdain.

## Final Answer:

Ancalagon, usually silent, whirled around to face Malagan, his feathered form tall and imposing. His eyes, usually calm and observant, were now ablaze with a strange mixture of anger and contempt.

"You ask us to sell our souls, Malagan?" he growled, the words coming out harsh and gravelly. The room fell silent, the tension palpable.

The owl-like creature's gaze was unblinking, cold. "I've made deals with beings far more terrifying than you could ever hope to be," Ancalagon continued, his voice low and menacing. "And I have not made it this far, have not survived what I have, to become a lackey in your pitiful guild."

He turned to look at Eldin, Mardook, and the captured Leonitus. "We are a family. We do not abandon our own. And we certainly do not trade our souls for them."

He turned back to Malagan, his eyes narrowing. "So here is my counter offer. Release Leonitus. And we won't tear this place apart, brick by brick."

His tone turned steely. "And if you think binding us to you will save you, you're mistaken. I've dealt with soul bonds before, and I assure you, if it comes to it, I can sever them. Your death won't be ours."

He let the words hang in the air, a silent challenge.

Action: Delegate work to co-worker
Action Input: {"coworker": "Paladin Writer", "task": "Write the scenes of the party working their way through the assassin's guild's lair", "context": "The party has worked its way through the secret lair of the Candlekeep assassin's guild in an attempt to recover a member of the party, Leonitus. They encounter various traps, enemies, and challenges along the way. The lair is filled with shadows and secrets, and the party must use their skills and 
teamwork to overcome the obstacles in their path."}

Eldin's journey through the assassin's guild's lair is fraught with both physical challenges and moral dilemmas. His strength and dedication are pushed to their limits as he fights against the shadows engulfing his path. He is driven by the greater good, the recovery of his friend Leonitus, and hatred for those who stand in his way.

## Final Answer:

As Eldin steps into the ominous lair, the dense, heavy air echoes with whispers of shadows and secrets. His blue scales shimmer under the dim, flickering light, reflecting an intimidating presence. The cold stone beneath his heavy armored feet reminds him of the trials that lie ahead. His grip tightens around his shield, and he draws a deep breath, repeating his oath to Bahamut in his mind.

Eldin, Ancalagon, and Mardook advance cautiously, each using their unique skills to navigate the maze-like structure. Eldin uses his exceptional strength to lift heavy obstacles and break down barricaded doors, his athletic prowess allows him to move quickly and efficiently through the labyrinth. His investigation skills help identify hidden traps, and his intimidating presence deters potential threats.

In one particular encounter, they come across a group of assassins. Eldin doesn't flinch; he stares them down, his eyes burning with the unreasoning hatred of his enemies. His persuasive skills, honed by years of service in Baulder's Gate scout regiment, prove useful in these moments as he convinces the assassins to let them pass without a fight.

As they delve deeper into the lair, Eldin's bond with his horse-fish becomes apparent. It serves as a beacon of hope, a constant reminder of his purpose, his honor. It provides a momentary relief from the grim surroundings, reminding Eldin of his roots, of the Stormtongue tribe he so dearly misses.

They face numerous trials, but Eldin's unwavering dedication to the greater good fuels him. He never loses sight of their mission - to rescue Leonitus. The very thought of leaving his comrade in enemy hands is unbearable. Eldin's strength, both physical and moral, is a guiding light for his companions in this dark lair.

As they finally confront the leader of the guild, the tension is palpable. Eldin's eyes narrow, his grip on the shield tightens, his body readies for the inevitable confrontation. His mind is clear, focused solely on the battle ahead. This is his moment, the test of his honor, his devotion to Bahamut, his loyalty to his friends. And Eldin is ready.

The key here is to show Leonitus's internal struggle with the decision, his concern for his friends, his distrust of Malagan and his underlying mission to find his father. I must also convey the tension in the group as they deliberate over their decision.

## Final Answer:

Leonitus, his scales a pale, ghostly white under the dim light of the lair, stood in silence, his eyes fixed on Malagan. The leader of the assassin's guild was a shadowy figure, an embodiment of the dangers they had trudged through in their quest to rescue him.

He felt a ripple of fear through his being, but he pushed it down, focusing instead on the matter at hand. His father's image, clouded by time and distance, flashed through his mind. But finding his father meant nothing if he 
was bound to this shadow, if his life and the lives of his friends were tethered to this man.

Leonitus glanced towards his companions. Eldin, the Paladin, was stalwart as always, his face a mask of determination. Ancalagon, the Warlock, was unreadable, his eyes a deep pool of contemplation. And Mardook, the rogue, was 
a picture of unease, his eyes darting nervously from Leonitus to Malagan.

In the midst of his turmoil, Leonitus felt an odd clarity. His honed instincts as a monk were screaming at him, warning him of the danger in trusting Malagan. His training in deception and stealth was screaming at him to see through the smoke, to uncover the truth hidden beneath Malagan's words.

His sun blade, a comforting weight at his side, seemed to pulse in sync with his heartbeat. He thought of its blaze, its warmth, and the power it held. It was a symbol of his strength, his determination, and his resolve to find his father. It was a symbol of his freedom, a freedom he would not easily give up to Malagan.

Leonitus looked back at Malagan, his gaze steady and unwavering. He had decisions to make, and his friends were looking to him for guidance. But he knew, with a certainty that ran deep within his bones, that he would not bind 
his soul to this man. He would not let his friends do so either. No matter the cost, they would find another way. They always did.

Action Input: {"coworker": "Rogue Writer", "task": "Write the scenes involving the party's jobs for Malagan and the potential consequences of Malagan's death", "context": "The party has worked its way through the secret lair of the Candlekeep assassin's guild in an attempt to recover a member of the party, Leonitus.

Mardook is no stranger to the underbelly of society, having been part of the thieves' guild. He is well aware of the risks associated with such a contract. However, the life of Leonitus hangs in the balance. Mardook is not one to trust easily, but he understands that this might be the only way to save Leonitus. He also sees this as an opportunity to gain some insight into the guild's operations, possibly leading him closer to the ones who framed him.

In his mind, he's already calculating the potential jobs Malagan might assign, and the risk associated with each. He's also considering the consequences of Malagan's death. As a rogue, he knows that the death of Malagan could 
lead to chaos within the guild, possibly resulting in his own death. However, he also knows that this could be a chance to bring down the guild from the inside.

## Final Answer:

In the scene, Mardook's eyes narrow as he considers Malagan's offer. His gaze flickers to Leonitus, a silent promise of rescue in his eyes. He turns back to Malagan, a grim determination set in his features.

"I accept," he says, a chill sweeping through the room as he binds his soul to the guild leader.

As Mardook begins to work for Malagan, he's cautious but efficient, always careful not to take on jobs that are too high risk. He carries out his tasks, but never loses sight of his ultimate goal - to dismantle the guild and clear his name.

He befriends other members of the guild, especially those who are isolated or who can provide him with valuable information. He also keeps his eyes open for any opportunities to undermine the guild or cause chaos that would distract from his own activities.

While he carries out each job, he leaves his mark, a phallac shape, subtly hidden in each location. It's his way of saying, "I was here," and also a way to confuse and amuse those who discover it.

Throughout it all, Mardook is aware of the looming threat of Malagan's death. If the guild leader dies, so does he. It's a risk he's willing to take, however, for the chance to clear his name and bring down the guild that betrayed him.

Despite the danger, Mardook keeps his spirits high, always ready with a joke or a prank. He maintains his friendships with Eldin, Ancalagon, and Leonitus, often relying on their support and companionship to get through the tough times.

In the end, Mardook is determined to survive, no matter what the guild throws at him. He's a rogue, after all, and he'll use every trick in the book to make sure he comes out on top.

Thought: Now that I have all the parts of the screenplay, it's time to put them together. I'll start with the scene written by the Paladin Writer, followed by the dialogue from the Warlock Writer. Then I'll add the scene from 
the Monk Writer, and finally, I'll include the scene from the Rogue Writer. This order should provide a coherent and engaging narrative for the screenplay.

I have to take my role as Eldin seriously and immerse myself into his character. Eldin's strength and resolve are key elements to his character and are crucial to his decisions. He's a hardy dragonborn with a strong sense of honor and duty. His loyalty is unwavering and he's ready to face any challenge for those he cares about. His relationship with Mardook is complex - a mix of trust, respect, and concern. He's worried about Mardook's decision to 
join the guild, but he's also aware that Mardook is capable and cunning. He's confident Mardook has a plan. In this situation, Eldin would stay true to his character and respond accordingly.

## Final Answer:
As Mardook's words echo in the silent room, Eldin's scales ripple with unease. His eyes, usually brimming with stoic determination, now glint with a hint of worry. He turns to Mardook, his trusted friend and comrade, his gaze 
hard but not without concern. "Mardook, you always had a knack for the unexpected," Eldin begins, his voice steady despite the lump in his throat. "Remember, though, a guild is more than its leader. It’s the people you work with, the bonds you forge. If you ever find yourself in a bind, we'll be there, rogue's honor." His gaze shifts back to Malagan, his expression hardening. "As for you, Malagan, know this - we are not your puppets. You may have Mardook's signature, but you don't have his loyalty. And you certainly don't have ours." With that, Eldin steps back, standing tall and resolute, his shield held high. He's ready to face any challenge that comes their way, with or without the guild.
